		<p>Here is a paragraph tag that has a <h4>Heading 4 tag </h4> in it ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
		adipisicing elit. A ab autem cupiditate deleniti dolores earum eius enim, incidunt ipsum maiores modi odit
			praesentium quam quasi quidem sit tempore veniam voluptatibus.</p>

			<h5>Here is a heading 5 tag to start our div block.</h5>
			<p>Notice how you don't see a difference. As we start CSS we will start to change how it looks and the
				div class will be more pronounced.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1</li>
				<li>2</li>
				<li>3</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Notice also the UL on  contains the nest list.  UL can have some css attributes added, but it too is
				just a shell for the list.  Try to change the li tags to ol tags and see what that difference is.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h6>A heading 6 tag to start a new div block</h6>
			<div>
				<p>Just a paragraph that's in a nested div block.</p>
				
				Look here, this code isn't in p tags.  If we add a bit of text here you can see how it compares to a p
				tag. Doesn't look too different doest it. However, this will just display as plain text. If we wanted
				to control characteristics of this block it would be hard to do.  If we wrap it in p tags and change
				the characteristics of how p tags show then we can control our code better.
				
				<p> This is a CSS concept we will be discussion in an upcoming blog.  For now this is a great
					opportunity to show how to link using our a tags.  Here is how we can link to a source not on
					our website.  A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">link</a>  to a page
					on css</p>
				
				<p>In our meta tag we added charset, which is an attribute or a characteristic of that tag. For a
					tags we use href (hypertext reference) to tell the browser the location we want to look.  We
					will touch more on what links are doing in the next blog. Also we put the work or even image we
					want to be the clickable part inside the tags. So in my example the word link is the hyperlink.
				 If you want the word CSS to be link then that goes in the tags like this <a
							href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a></p>
				
				<p>We can do <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">multiple words</a></p>
				
				<p>Now lets do multiple words with an image.  First lets display an image using img tag. This will
					require some attributes as well. <img
							src="https://prodix-blog.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/icon.png" alt="Prodix Solutions">
					Before we link it lets talk about those attributes.  "scr" this is the location of the image. For
					now its just link to a file on the web.  Don't confuse this as being a hyperlink, this is instead
					just searing the web.  As i mentioned we will discuss folder and files in the next blog and this
					will all come together. The "alt" attribute is used in case the image cant be found.  Maybe the
					link changed or the file removed. You may have seen this before where a picture doesnt load.  The
					alt will then kick in and display the text.  This can be whatever you want it to be.  Just
					remember the longer it is the more space it will take up and will really change things around
					when we get to how css displays.
				</p>
				
				<p>So now lets make our image be a link to somewhere. so like before we put pur a tag and fill in
					our href. then instead of the words we will use our image just like we did before and we end up
					with this.
					<a href="https://prodixsolutions.com">
						<img src="https://prodix-blog.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/icon.png" alt="Prodix Solutions">
					</a>
				</p>
				
				<p>So we can put these a tags where we want a link, we can do buttons, inside lists, inside headers,
				they just have to in our body to be clickable. This will become more evident shortly. Notice one
					thing here about my last a and img tags.  See how the opening and closing of the a tags are on
					different lines and the img is inside it on its own line. This is part of keeping the code clean
				and readable.  Sure i can smash it all together and make it work, I can even spread things out more,
					and it works the same. The point is that you can space things around and the browser still knows
				what to do.  If I had these paragraphs on one line it would be hard to read, instead I keep short
					lines and the browser will display this still in the correct format</p>
				
				<p>So there are some html code you will use alot.  Now when we look at this page, its ugly
					and lacks all kinds of eye candy.  We are going to focus on fixing that.</p>
